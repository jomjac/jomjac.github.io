## Motivations 

As a proud alumnus of the National Agrarian University La Molina with a degree in Economics, I am deeply passionate about elucidating complex concepts that have captivated meâ€”Game Theory, Econometrics, Corporate Finance, and Financial Risk. My journey has been about enriching these areas with a twist of programming, diving into the intricacies of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. I've crafted my portfolio with the hope that it serves as a valuable resource for you. Moreover, I aspire to not only assist you but also to empower you to create a web presence as dynamic as this one.

A mantra that has been instrumental in my growth and the genesis of this site is, <strong>"The quality of our lives is determined by the quality of the decisions we make."</strong> This belief has been the compass that has guided me in my life and has greatly motivated my professional growth

<p>In the spirit of sharing knowledge that inspires, here's a video that resonates with my vision and ethos:

Welcome to my world, where data meets decisions, and insights become actions.
