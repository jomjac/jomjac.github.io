The aim is to make the topics of <strong>econometrics</strong>, <strong>industrial organization</strong>, <strong>macroeconomics</strong>, and <strong>microeconomics</strong> as accessible and understandable as possible. Content is being prepared using LaTeX  for typesetting and <strong>xaringan</strong> for dynamic presentation slides in R. </p>
