I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to the creators and maintainers of the template that has become the cornerstone of my academic website. A special thanks goes to Stuart Geiger, whose fork of the Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme by Michael Rose has been instrumental in the development of my site. The generosity of sharing such a well-constructed template under the MIT License has made it accessible for individuals like myself to create and share our work with the world.

My website's existence is also a tribute to Tony Dear, from whose repository I forked and further tailored my site. Tony's enhancements and the meticulous attention to detail have provided a seamless experience in adapting the template to my needs.

Their contributions to the open-source community exemplify the collaborative spirit of sharing knowledge and tools, which has not only facilitated my journey in setting up a professional online presence but also serves as an inspiration for me to contribute back to the community. The instructions, detailed documentation, and the active management of issues and updates have been a guidepost for me during this process.

To both Stuart and Tony, thank you for your invaluable work. It is the unsung heroes like you who make the gears of the open-source community turn, enabling so many of us to learn, grow, and give back. I am truly appreciative of your efforts and am proud to be a part of this community.
